## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**üö´ DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these methods:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
- Go to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/vless-worker)
- Navigate to **Security** tab ‚Üí **Advisories**
- Click **Report a vulnerability**
- Fill out the security advisory form

#### 2. Email
Send an email to: **security@vless-worker.dev**
- Use subject: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report`
- Include detailed description and steps to reproduce
- Attach any proof-of-concept code or screenshots

#### 3. Encrypted Communication
For highly sensitive reports, use our PGP key:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be here in real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Current Security Features

#### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **UUID Validation**: Cryptographically strong UUID validation
- **Protocol Authentication**: VLESS protocol-level authentication
- **No Default Credentials**: All UUIDs must be explicitly configured

#### üîí Encryption & Transport Security
- **TLS 1.3**: Latest TLS version with perfect forward secrecy
- **AEAD Encryption**: Authenticated encryption with associated data
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict certificate validation
- **HSTS Headers**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled

#### üåê Network Security
- **WebSocket Security**: Secure WebSocket (WSS) connections only
- **DNS over HTTPS**: Secure DNS resolution to prevent DNS hijacking
- **IP Filtering**: Built-in IP validation and filtering
- **Rate Limiting**: Cloudflare's built-in DDoS protection

#### üèóÔ∏è Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure
- **Memory Safety**: JavaScript runtime provides memory safety
- **Sandboxing**: Cloudflare Workers runtime sandboxing

### Security by Design

#### üéØ Principle of Least Privilege
- Workers run with minimal required permissions
- No access to sensitive Cloudflare account data
- Isolated execution environment

#### üîç Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Protocol-level and application-level security
- Network and transport layer protection

#### üìä Zero Trust Architecture
- No implicit trust of network traffic
- Every connection is authenticated and encrypted
- Continuous validation of connections

## üöÄ Secure Deployment Guidelines

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Security

#### UUID Management
```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use cryptographically secure UUIDs
const userIDs = [
  'f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479',
  'e9e3cc13-db48-4cc1-8c24-7626439a5339'
];

// ‚ùå BAD: Don't use predictable or weak UUIDs
const userIDs = [
  '12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012',
  'aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee'
];
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Store sensitive config in environment variables
wrangler secret put ADMIN_UUID
wrangler secret put API_TOKEN

# ‚ùå BAD: Don't hardcode secrets in _worker.js
const adminUUID = 'hardcoded-uuid-here';
```

### üåê Network Security

#### Custom Domains
```yaml
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Use custom domains with proper DNS setup
route = { pattern = "vless.yourdomain.com/*", zone_name = "yourdomain.com" }

# ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE: Workers.dev domains (less optimal for security)
name = "vless-worker"
```

#### ProxyIP Selection
```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use reputable CDN endpoints
const proxyIPs = [
  'cdn.cloudflare.com',
  'workers.cloudflare.com'
];

// ‚ùå BAD: Don't use untrusted or suspicious IPs
const proxyIPs = [
  '192.168.1.1',
  'suspicious-domain.com'
];
```

### üîç Monitoring & Logging

#### Security Monitoring
- Enable Cloudflare Analytics
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Regular security audits of configuration

#### Logging Best Practices
```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Log security events without sensitive data
console.log('Authentication failed for UUID ending in:', uuid.slice(-4));

// ‚ùå BAD: Don't log sensitive information
console.log('Authentication failed for UUID:', uuid);
```

## üîÑ Security Update Process
